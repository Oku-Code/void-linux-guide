* Void Setup guide

Hola, in this case i'm going to cover *Void Linux* distribution installation, using btrfs and snapper for create snapshots of your system automatically.

** What do you find here:

1. A writing guide for the installation process of Void Linux.
2. Detailed guide to configure snapper, covering the basics of the software.
3. A fstab template file for reference. 

- *Note*: If you have another partition scheme it's better copy the =/proc/mounts= file into /mnt/etc/ directory and edit like explains on the [[https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/guides/chroot.html#configure-fstab][wiki page]].
