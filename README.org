* Void Setup guide

Here i'm again with another guide, in this case i'm cover *Void Linux* distribution, using btrfs and snapper for create snapshots of your system automatically.

** What do you find here:

1. A writing guide for the installation process of  Void Linux
2. A script to snapper on void
3. A installation script for /glibc/ version of void
4. A fstab template file, if you don't want edit file copied from =/proc/mounts/=, put the UUDIs of your disks and check the btrfs IDS for your subvolumes

- *Note*: If you have another partition scheme it's better copy the =/proc/mounts= file into /mnt/etc/ directory and edit like explains on the [[https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/guides/chroot.html#configure-fstab][wiki page]] or how *myTerminal* explains in their [[https://gist.github.com/myTerminal/82de59c83b2057868260d7185013e6d1#filesystem][guide]].
